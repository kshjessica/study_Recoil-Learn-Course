- Intro

  - Course Intro
  - Overview of Recoil
    - **Why build Recoil?**  
      the nature of the app has large number of rendered components that needs to be frequently update in isolation
    - **Recoil's Key Features**
      - _Flexible shared state_
        - boilerplate-free as simple as get/set
        - allows code-splitting
      - _Derived data_
        - data can be derived safely and simply from state and other derived data
        - access derived data same way one would access state
        - derived data can be synchronous or asynchronous
      - _App-wide state observation_
        - read any part of Recoil state
        - observe changes to state
        - persist application state
        - rehydration (backwards compatible)
    - **Why use Recoil?**  
       works particularly well when component tree and state structure don't match
