  - Course Intro
  - Overview of Recoil  
    ✅ **Why build Recoil?**  
    : the nature of the app has large number of rendered components that needs to be frequently update in isolation  
    ✅ **Recoil's Key Features**
    - Flexible shared state  
      : boilerplate-free as simple as get/set  
      : allows code-splitting
    - Derived data  
      : data can be derived safely and simply from state and other derived data  
      : access derived data same way one would access state  
      : derived data can be synchronous or asynchronous
    - App-wide state observation  
       : read any part of Recoil state
      : observe changes to state
      : persist application state
      : rehydration (backwards compatible)  
      ✅ **Why use Recoil?**  
      : works particularly well when component tree and state structure don't match
