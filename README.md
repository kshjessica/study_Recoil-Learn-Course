-   Intro

    -   Course Intro
    -   Overview of Recoil
        -   **Why build Recoil?**  
            the nature of the app has large number of rendered components that needs to be frequently update in isolation
        -   **Recoil's Key Features**
            -   _Flexible shared state_
                -   boilerplate-free as simple as get/set
                -   allows code-splitting
            -   _Derived data_
                -   data can be derived safely and simply from state and other derived data
                -   access derived data same way one would access state
                -   derived data can be synchronous or asynchronous
            -   _App-wide state observation_
                -   read any part of Recoil state
                -   observe changes to state
                -   persist application state
                -   rehydration (backwards compatible)
        -   **Why use Recoil?**  
             works particularly well when component tree and state structure don't match
